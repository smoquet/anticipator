    Anticipator is a Spotify playlist generator, based on the lineup of the event
    of your choice. We'll add a couple tracks (you get too choose how much!1) from
    each artist that will perform at the event to a playlist. For this we'll need
    (limited!) access to your Spotify account. </br>
    </br>
    Unfortunately, at the moment we can only generate Spotify playlists. Vote here
    for other music services.
